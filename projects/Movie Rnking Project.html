<p>Ronal is a young barbarian with low self-esteem, the polar opposite of all the muscular barbarians in his village. However, as fate would have it, responsibility for the tribe's survival falls on Ronal's scrawny shoulders, when the evil Lord Volcazar raids the village and abducts every living barbarian. With the exception of Ronal, who is forced to go on a perilous quest to save his enslaved clan and thwart Volcazar's plot to rule the world? Along the way, Alibert the buttery bard, Zandra the gorgeous shield-maiden and Elric the elfin guide join our unlikely hero. To ultimately vanquish the enemy, the band must overcome awesome challenges.</p>
